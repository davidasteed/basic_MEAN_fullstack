# basic_MEAN_fullstack

To prepare for a job interview coding assignment, I was asked to prepare a basic full stack application using the stack I learned at The Iron Yard.  This application is a basic web form that will allow CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations against a "user" object stored in a database.

This project will also serve as the basis for other full stack applications as needed.  Technology used:  the "MEAN stack":  MongoDB database, Express.js middleware, Angular v1 MVC, and Node.js.
